	1. Interpolation is the insertion of an item. Concatenation combines two statements or "arguments"
	2. DRY stands for don't repeat yourself. It is important because we want our code to be as simple and as easy to read as possible, not only for ourselves, but for others.  
	3. Declaring a variable is the act of naming the variable, it makes the variable tangent and in essence, permanent. Assigning a variable is non-perminant. Defining the variable is assigning it a value. 
	4. Const means the variable will be constant across the board. Let on the otherhand defines the variable only for that block action. 
	5. The parent directory is the directory that other directories and files reside in
	6. Type Help
	7. Tab completion is when you press a letter and then press tab and it unix auto completes it for you. It's dope because it will save you time from having to continuously type out directories.

	const a = 4;
	const b = 53;
	const c = 57;
	const d = 16;
	const e = 'Kevin';


	1 a < b;
	2 c > d;
	3 ===
	4 < &&
	5 === <
	6 ===
	7 ==

	loops 

	1 it is an infinite loop
	2 it is an inifinte loop because you cannot reassign constants 
	3 it would give you the letter U. The code would run and list the letters as long as the initiator was less than 20, when it got to 20 it would run it one more time. 

	the difference between the two types of loops is that a for loop allows for more customization than a while loop when figuring the parameters.

	for loop;
		var i = "";


for ( i = 0; i < 999; i +=1) {console.log(i);} 

	3a. sets the variable
	b. loop condition
	c. increments

	for loop backwards
			var i = "";


for ( i = 999; i < 0; i -=1) {console.log(i);}
